Time complexity: Amount of time algorithm needs to run relative to input size.
Space complexity: Amount of memory allocated by the algorithm when run relative to the input size.

What we want to focus on is how an algorithm scales with the input size.

When talking about complexity, there are normally three cases:
a. Best case scenario
b. Average case
c. Worst case scenario

It is most correct to use the worst case scenario, but you should be able to talk about the difference between the cases.

Time complexity example:
// Given an integer array "arr" with length n,
for (int num: arr) {
    print(num)
}
It has time complexity O(n)
-> In each for loop iteration, we are performing print which costs O(1)
-> For loop iterates n times, which gives time-complexity O(1.n) = O(n)

eg2:
for (int num: arr) {  ----> Iterates n times
    for (int i = 0; i < 500,000; i++) {  -> Iterates 500,000 times
        print(num)                       -> Time complexity: O(1)
    }
}
Total Time complexity: O(500,000*n) = O(n)

eg3:
for (int num: arr) {        -> O(n)
    for (int num2: arr) {   -> O(n)
        print(num * num2)   -> Time complexity: O(1)
    }
}
Total Time complexity: O(n*n) = O(n^2)

eg4:
// Given integer arrays "arr" with length n and "arr2" with length m,

for (int num: arr) {    -> O(n)
    print(num)
}

for (int num: arr) {    -> O(n)
    print(num)
}

for (int num: arr2) {    ->O(m)
    print(num)
}

Total time complexity: O(n+n+m) = O(2n+m) = O(n+m)

eg5:
// Given an integer array "arr" with length n,

for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    for (int j = i; j < arr.length; j++) {
        print(arr[i] + arr[j])
    }
}

The inner for loop is dependent on what iteration the outer for loop is currently on.
First time, inner for loop runs n times.
Second time, inner for loop runs n-1 times.
Third time, inner for loop runs n-2 times and so on.

Total iterations = 1+2+..+n = n(n+1)/2 = O(n^2)

Note: Time complexity for efficient sorting algorithms: O(nlogn)
Note: Base of the logarithm doesn't actually matter for big O, since all logarithms are related by a constant factor.
