Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.
You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

eg:
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]

Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]

Hint:
Use 2 pointer approach: One at beginning of string, other at end.
