Example 1: 
Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, false otherwise.

A string is a palindrome if it reads the same forward as backward. That means, after reversing it, it is still the same string. For example: "abcdcba", or "racecar".

To start, we check the first and last characters using two separate pointers.
To check the next pair of characters, we just need to move our pointers toward each other one position.
We continue until 
a. The pointers meet each other (or)
b. We find a mismatch.
