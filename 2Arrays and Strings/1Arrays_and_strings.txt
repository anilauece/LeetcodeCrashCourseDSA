Arrays and Strings: Both are ordered collection of elements that can be iterated over.
                 Arrays
Python -> Lists
eg: arr = [] (initialization)
-> We can use any data-type in lists, no need to worry about size.
-> No need to mention the size.

C++ -> Specify array type and data-size during initialization

std:: vector: Similar to lists in C++
-> Specify the data-type of array during initialization.

                Strings
Python, Java -> Immutable
C++   -> Mutable
Note: It's important to know the details behind arrays and strings for the language you plan on using in interviews.
