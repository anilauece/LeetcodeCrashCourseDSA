Arrays and Strings: Both are ordered collection of elements that can be iterated over.
                 Arrays
Python -> Lists
eg: arr = [] (initialization)
-> We can use any data-type in lists, no need to worry about size.
-> No need to mention the size.

C++ -> Specify array data-type and array size during initialization

std:: vector: Similar to lists in C++
-> Specify the data-type of array during initialization.

                Strings
Python, Java -> Immutable
C++   -> Mutable
Note: It's important to know the details behind arrays and strings for the language you plan on using in interviews.
Mutable: a type of data that can be changed.
Immutable: A type of data that cannot be changed. If you want to change something immutable, you will need to recreate the entire thing.

----------------------------------------------------------------
|        Operation           | Array/List    | String(Immutable)|
-----------------------------------------------------------------
| Appending to end           |   *O(1)       |      O(n)        |
| Popping from end           |    O(1)       |      O(n)        |
| Insertion, not from end    |    O(n)       |      O(n)        |
| Deletion, not from end     |    O(n)       |      O(n)        |
| Modifying an element       |    O(1)       |      O(n)        |
| Random access              |    O(1)       |      O(1)        |
| Checking if element exists |    O(n)       |      O(n)        |
-----------------------------------------------------------------

*O(1) -> Amortized O(1) (or) O(1) is average number of operations

We will discuss most commonly used techniques in arrays and strings.
